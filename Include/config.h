// CL_VEL_CHIRP instability events used to end with the whole system frozen.
// Root cause: EXTI15_10_IRQHandler (CS rising edge, NVIC priority 0 --
// highest in the system) was passively waiting for DMA1_Stream4's TX
// enable bit to self-clear, which only happens if the host's SPI
// transaction completed all 32 bytes on its own. A short/glitched host
// transaction leaves the stream permanently mid-transfer with no more
// clock edges ever coming, so it never self-clears -- confirmed live via
// debugger (stall_guard counting all the way down). At priority 0, burning
// the full ~6-8ms bound there blocks the main control loop, ADC, and
// everything else for the duration -- that's what was actually causing the
// "instability" all session; disabling SPI entirely (3 clean passes, no
// freeze) proved it wasn't the velocity loop. Fixed properly in
// EXTI15_10_IRQHandler (spi.c) -- it now force-disables the stream instead
// of waiting on natural completion, so re-enabling telemetry here.

// Bus voltage
// =============================================================================

// 12V is the only bus voltage actually validated tonight. 24V was
// discussed and drafted in this file at one point but the PSU was never
// actually changed to it -- a "76.7% torn SPI frames" result earlier that
// got misattributed to 24V was really at 12V, running
// SYSID_TEST_POSITION_STEP (a big, fast, saturating move). So the real,
// confirmed picture:
//
//  - 12V, big/fast step move, SPI at 4MHz: 76.7% torn frames. Slowing the
//    Pi's SPI clock to 1MHz (spi_open_configure() speed_hz in foc-sysid's
//    main.cpp -- a Pi-side runtime arg, no firmware change) dropped that to
//    12% -- real improvement, not a full fix. Scope on MISO (STM32 output)
//    vs. SCK (from the Pi) showed MISO riding on visible noise, including a
//    slow DC-level shift mid-burst while SCK kept clocking normally --
//    direct evidence of noise coupling onto the line itself (likely PWM/
//    motor switching related), not a firmware or protocol bug. Wiring is
//    already the shortest jumpers available, so length/routing isn't a
//    lever here.
//  - 16V (the one real voltage change tried): the Pi's capture tool gets no
//    usable SPI data at all -- gives up before ALIGN even finishes -- while
//    the STM32 control loop keeps running correctly regardless (motion
//    confirmed physically). Worse than 12V's partial corruption, which
//    argues against a simple "more voltage = more noise" relationship.
//  - 24V: not actually tried. Don't trust any comment/number attributed to
//    24V from earlier tonight.
//
// Net: SPI corruption is real even at the "known good" 12V under heavy
// switching, and gets worse (not better, not proportionally) at 16V. This
// is a bench hardware question (scope the SPI2 signal path and whatever
// feeds its logic levels) -- not something more config changes or clock
// tweaks alone are going to fully resolve. Staying at 12V, since it's the
// only setting where the SPI link is usable at all, even if imperfectly.
//
// Doesn't touch the current loop's design regardless of value: P(s)=1/(Ls+R)
// and CURRENT_LOOP_KP/KI depend only on motor R/L, not V_BUS -- this only
// moves the +-(V_BUS/2) saturation clamp (loops.c pi_init calls) and the PWM
// normalization range (pwm.c), both already written generically off this

// auto-design: predicted gc=71.92Hz/PM=60deg/GM=8.8dB; measured whole-
// system result was actually better than predicted -- gc=32.17Hz,
// PM=60.7deg, pc=88.48Hz, GM=16.6dB, 32.6Hz BW, SYSID_TEST_CL_POS_CHIRP).
// Margins were excellent, but that chirp-based verification only checks
// small-signal stability, not idle noise -- SYSID_TEST_POSITION_STEP then
// showed continuous chatter at rest (vq buzzing ~+-2-3V, iq_meas
// ~+-400-800mA, vel_meas dense noise throughout, not just at step edges).
// Reverting CURRENT_LOOP_KP/KI to the 500Hz-target gains didn't fix it,
// which points at this gain: at 954.5, ordinary vel_meas noise (from
// VEL_FILTER_N=20's shorter/noisier window) gets amplified into real
// velocity-command jitter that the inner loops then chase continuously.
// Was reverted to 200 (the last value with a clean, quiet step response)
// on the STAGE-ATTACHED config -- that history stands, but doesn't
// directly apply here since VEL_KP/KI were just re-designed against a
// fresh bare-motor plant (see loops.c) and closed-loop verified
// (gc=44.6Hz, PM=69.2deg, GM=15.1dB, BW=80.4Hz).
//
// Re-derived as a frequency-ratio design instead: pick outer crossover at
// 1/3-1/5 of the velocity loop's measured -3dB BW (80.4Hz), read H(jf)
// AT that frequency from the same verification run's raw data (not
// assumed unity), size Kp_pos so |Kp_pos*H(jf)/jf|=1 there:
//   1/3  (26.80Hz): H=0.26dB   Kp_pos=163.37  PM=57.7deg
//   1/4  (20.10Hz): H=0.13dB   Kp_pos=124.45  PM=68.0deg  <- chosen, middle of range
//   1/5  (16.08Hz): H=0.24dB   Kp_pos=98.31   PM=73.1deg
//
// Closed-loop verified directly (SYSID_TEST_CL_POS_CHIRP, bare motor,
// whole-system H_pos(s)=pos_meas/pos_cmd, margin backed out via
// L=H_pos/(1-H_pos)): gain crossover landed at 21.11Hz, within 5% of the
// 20.10Hz this Kp was sized for -- reading real H(jf) instead of assuming
// unity gain got the crossover right. PM=73.0deg (beat the 68.0deg
// prediction), GM=16.6dB. Measured -3dB bandwidth is 42.64Hz, roughly 2x
// the crossover -- NOT the same thing as gc, don't confuse the two: BW
// exceeding gc is the standard consequence of PM<90deg (mild peaking near
// crossover extends the -3dB point outward), same mechanism as the
// velocity loop's 80.4Hz BW vs its 44.6Hz gc. The number actually designed
// for (crossover) landed almost exactly on target.

// Superseded by the stage-attached + friction-feedforward design below --
// 124.45 was sized against the bare-motor velocity loop (no stage, no
// feedforward) and is kept here only as prior-art history, not the active
// value.
//
// Re-derived after: (1) attaching the stage, (2) characterizing its
// friction (SYSID_TEST_FRICTION_SWEEP, 3 repeat runs: Fc~94mA, Fv~1.9mA per
// rad/s), and (3) folding that in as feedforward (velocity_loop_step(),
// loops.c) instead of leaving the velocity PI to fight it -- confirmed by
// re-running the CL_VEL_CHIRP amplitude=8-vs-15 comparison, which had
// previously shown a ~2x different backed-out plant gain/tau depending on
// amplitude (friction dominating a P-only loop's response, not a real
// plant nonlinearity): with feedforward active, DC gain converged to
// -0.01/-0.09dB at both amplitudes (was -8.67/-4.02dB), confirming the
// feedforward-compensated system behaves consistently enough to design
// against.
//
// Sized phase-margin-targeted (not decade-below-BW) off that feedforward-
// compensated closed velocity loop (H(s)=vel_meas/vel_cmd, amplitude=15
// rad/s run): DC gain -0.01dB, -3dB BW=107.0Hz. Crossover picked where H's
// phase lag gives ~60deg position-loop PM, Kp_pos sized off the ACTUAL
// measured gain there (0.17dB), not assumed unity:
//   gain crossover 33.35Hz, PM=60.0deg, GM=10.7dB (open-loop check,
//   L(s)=Kp_pos*H(s)/s)
// Not yet closed-loop verified with a real SYSID_TEST_CL_POS_CHIRP run on
// the stage-attached + feedforward system (bare-motor precedent above found
// the predicted crossover landed within 5% once closed-loop verified --
// worth repeating that check here before trusting this number blindly).

// Cine sweep — same closed-loop position chirp, but sized for FILMING. Now
// deliberately swept PAST both gains' real tracking limit -- the point isn't
// just to look pretty, it's to visibly show the system run out of bandwidth
// (or hit its velocity clamp) as frequency climbs: measured amplitude
// shrinking below commanded, growing phase lag, eventually degenerating into
// a blurred/reduced-amplitude wobble instead of clean tracking. The overlay
// graph (cine_overlay_render.py) makes the breakdown legible even once the
// physical motion itself is too fast to resolve by eye.
//
// AMPLITUDE was cut from 0.4 to 0.25 rad so the failure you see is genuinely
// BANDWIDTH-driven for as much of the sweep as possible, not an artifact of
