// CL_VEL_CHIRP instability events used to end with the whole system frozen.
// Root cause: EXTI15_10_IRQHandler (CS rising edge, NVIC priority 0 --
// highest in the system) was passively waiting for DMA1_Stream4's TX
// enable bit to self-clear, which only happens if the host's SPI
// transaction completed all 32 bytes on its own. A short/glitched host
// transaction leaves the stream permanently mid-transfer with no more
// clock edges ever coming, so it never self-clears -- confirmed live via
// debugger (stall_guard counting all the way down). At priority 0, burning
// the full ~6-8ms bound there blocks the main control loop, ADC, and
// everything else for the duration -- that's what was actually causing the
// "instability" all session; disabling SPI entirely (3 clean passes, no
// freeze) proved it wasn't the velocity loop. Fixed properly in
// EXTI15_10_IRQHandler (spi.c) -- it now force-disables the stream instead
// of waiting on natural completion, so re-enabling telemetry here.

// Bus voltage
// =============================================================================

// 12V is the only bus voltage actually validated tonight. 24V was
// discussed and drafted in this file at one point but the PSU was never
// actually changed to it -- a "76.7% torn SPI frames" result earlier that
// got misattributed to 24V was really at 12V, running
// SYSID_TEST_POSITION_STEP (a big, fast, saturating move). So the real,
// confirmed picture:
//
//  - 12V, big/fast step move, SPI at 4MHz: 76.7% torn frames. Slowing the
//    Pi's SPI clock to 1MHz (spi_open_configure() speed_hz in foc-sysid's
//    main.cpp -- a Pi-side runtime arg, no firmware change) dropped that to
//    12% -- real improvement, not a full fix. Scope on MISO (STM32 output)
//    vs. SCK (from the Pi) showed MISO riding on visible noise, including a
//    slow DC-level shift mid-burst while SCK kept clocking normally --
//    direct evidence of noise coupling onto the line itself (likely PWM/
//    motor switching related), not a firmware or protocol bug. Wiring is
//    already the shortest jumpers available, so length/routing isn't a
//    lever here.
//  - 16V (the one real voltage change tried): the Pi's capture tool gets no
//    usable SPI data at all -- gives up before ALIGN even finishes -- while
//    the STM32 control loop keeps running correctly regardless (motion
//    confirmed physically). Worse than 12V's partial corruption, which
//    argues against a simple "more voltage = more noise" relationship.
//  - 24V: not actually tried. Don't trust any comment/number attributed to
//    24V from earlier tonight.
//
// Net: SPI corruption is real even at the "known good" 12V under heavy
// switching, and gets worse (not better, not proportionally) at 16V. This
// is a bench hardware question (scope the SPI2 signal path and whatever
// feeds its logic levels) -- not something more config changes or clock
// tweaks alone are going to fully resolve. Staying at 12V, since it's the
// only setting where the SPI link is usable at all, even if imperfectly.
//
// Doesn't touch the current loop's design regardless of value: P(s)=1/(Ls+R)
// and CURRENT_LOOP_KP/KI depend only on motor R/L, not V_BUS -- this only
// moves the +-(V_BUS/2) saturation clamp (loops.c pi_init calls) and the PWM
// normalization range (pwm.c), both already written generically off this

// Fresh SYSID_TEST_CURRENT_LOOP_CHIRP run (rotor locked, 1.0A amplitude,

// has a zero/pole ratio of 1.053 -- essentially perfect cancellation --
// and predicts BW=255Hz by construction. That was independently
// corroborated by SYSID_TEST_CL_CURRENT_CHIRP (closed-loop iq_cmd->iq_meas
// chirp, rotor locked): raw -3dB crossing 197-300Hz across two runs,
// single-pole curve fit of the full coherent band 361Hz, backed-out real

// didn't. The actual cause was encoder_update()'s velocity filter group
// delay (encoder.c, VEL_FILTER_N 80->20) -- fixing that took the closed

// PM=60.7deg, pc=88.48Hz, GM=16.6dB, 32.6Hz BW, SYSID_TEST_CL_POS_CHIRP).
// Margins were excellent, but that chirp-based verification only checks
// small-signal stability, not idle noise -- SYSID_TEST_POSITION_STEP then
// showed continuous chatter at rest (vq buzzing ~+-2-3V, iq_meas
// ~+-400-800mA, vel_meas dense noise throughout, not just at step edges).
// Reverting CURRENT_LOOP_KP/KI to the 500Hz-target gains didn't fix it,
// which points at this gain: at 954.5, ordinary vel_meas noise (from

// 20.10Hz this Kp was sized for -- reading real H(jf) instead of assuming
// unity gain got the crossover right. PM=73.0deg (beat the 68.0deg
// prediction), GM=16.6dB. Measured -3dB bandwidth is 42.64Hz, roughly 2x
// the crossover -- NOT the same thing as gc, don't confuse the two: BW
